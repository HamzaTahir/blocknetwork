# Bitcoin distribution

In January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with the release of the first open source bitcoin client and the issuance of the first bitcoins, with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the first block of bitcoins ever (known as the genesis block), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins.

This is how the first 50 bitcoins were generated.

# Miners Reward Model

When a block is discovered, the discoverer may award themselves a certain number of bitcoins, which is agreed-upon by everyone in the network. Currently this bounty is 12.5 bitcoins; this value will halve every 210,000 blocks.
Users doing transaction are also reward the miner a fee to add their transaction in their block.


# Blocks Validation

Miners post their blocks online and the people in the network choose the block to be added to block chain, Mostly the one with high number of validated transactions is choosen and added to the block chain.


# Transactions validation

When a transaction is posted online,the miners all the blocks in the block chain and from previous transaction to and from that public key are checked whether the person doing transaction has enough bitcoins to be transferred. if it checks true the trasaction is validated.


# Segregated Witness

A soft fork that allow to seperate the transaction signatures from part of data in a transaction covered by txid. Reducing Transaction Size allowing more transactions to be added to the block.

# Attacks on Bitcoin

Recently a DDoS attack was lauched on bitcoin in march 2017 for about a week.

Allinvain(The persone that was hacked): 25,000 bitcoins were stolen from their wallet after hackers compromised the Windows computer they were using.

Mt Gox: An attacker with a Hong Kong IP address compromised an account on the site, and then made a massive sale of bitcoins, causing the price of the currency to drop from $32.00 per coin to mere pennies.

# Flaws of bitcoin

Bitcoin use is increasing, so it means more number of transactions it would take much more time for some transactions to be verified,if they are not included till the first block is created after the transaction then it has to wait more.

if you have lost your private key you have lost your bitcoins and they are of no use to you and anyone.

if someone has your private key then he has access to all of your money.

# Double Spending solved

in order to made a transaction you have to post a contract online like "I am giving ali 0.000123 bitcoins with serial no123456" so it means that you cannot use this bitcoin again.

# Total supply of bitcoins

20999999.9769 possible bitcoins to be produced overall.


# Application of Blockchain

(https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-applications-of-Blockchain-other-than-Cryptocurrency):

## Distributed cloud storage
This offers a way to store data on a peer -to -peer network against having to rely on a central cloud storage service such as Dropbox, Amazon, and Google drive.

## Distributed asset ledger
It can be used to track ownership real world assets through attached pieces of data, which is accessible via private keys held by the owner. The holders of the private keys can exchange assets while viewing the transfers on a transparent ledger in real time.

## Decentralized notary
Timestamp feature. The whole network essentially validates the state of wrapped piece of data (called a hash) at a certain specific time. As a trustless decentralized network, it essentially confirms the existence of something at a stated time that is further provable in a court of law. Until now, only centralized notary services could serve this purpose.

# Smart contracts
These are legally binding programmable digitized contracts entered on the blockchain. They are smart because they are automated and can self-execute.

# Bitcoin FuturePredictions
It's market share will decrease as new cryptocurrencies are growing e.g ethereum and tezos is aboutto launch which has worked on the problems discussed in bitcoin.

Bitcoin value has fallen everytie it was hacked like during MTGox hack bitcoin value fell down massively.
